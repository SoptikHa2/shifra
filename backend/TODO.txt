TODO:
    -> Rework URL ( discussion between Damian, Marek, Pavel )
    -> DONE Look on deleteCipherGame ( it does not work even though SQL is correct and it works for all the other classes )
    -> DONE deleteCipher just won't show ( I have no idea why )
    -> Discuss updateObject scenarios   -> discussion between Pavel, Marek, Damian
                                        -> Damian will rework this
    -> DONE Look into connection ( how with works and how to eliminate multiple connection opening or too much modifying of the connection ) -> consult with SoptÃ­k
    -> DONE Make database connection data less vulnerable ( moving it all to json file settings.json )

All the mistakes I found so far, this version shall be uploaded to github and reworked.
